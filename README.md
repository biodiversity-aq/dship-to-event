# DSHIP to Darwin Core Event

This repository provides an R workflow to transform [DSHIP](https://spaces.awi.de/spaces/EFPW/pages/324149323/DSHIP-System) station/event metadata exports (TSV format) into a tables containing the [Darwin Core Event Core (2024-02-19)](https://rs.gbif.org/core/dwc_event_2024-02-19.xml) standard.

```

## Getting Started

This project uses renv to manage R packages for reproducibility.

1.  Clone the repository
2.  Open R / RStudio in the project directory.
3.  Restore the package environment:

``` r
renv::restore()
```

4.  Run the script:

``` r
source("R/transform_dship_to_event.R")
```

## Automated Processing

This repository includes a GitHub Action that automatically runs the transformation script every 10 minutes. The workflow:

1. Sets up the R environment with the correct version (4.5.1)
2. Restores the renv package environment
3. Runs the transformation script using the `O2A_EXPORT` environment variable
4. Commits and pushes any changes to the processed data files

### Configuration

The GitHub Action requires the `O2A_EXPORT` variable to be set in the repository variables. This should contain the URL to the DSHIP data export.

To configure this:
1. Go to your repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
2. Add a new repository variable named `O2A_EXPORT` with the appropriate URL value

### Manual Execution

You can also manually trigger the workflow from the Actions tab in GitHub, or run the script locally as described above.

## Notes & Assumptions

      
- If both profile and station actions exist, the workflow uses profile start/end.
- Coordinates are rounded to 4 decimal places.
- coordinateUncertaintyInMeters is calculated using obistools::calculate_centroid() (or set to 0 for identical start/end points).
- eventDate handling:
  - Same-day events → YYYY-MM-DD with separate eventTime.
  - Multi-day events → full datetime interval in eventDate, blank eventTime.
